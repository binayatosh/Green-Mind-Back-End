# Backend Project Structure and File Overview

This document provides an overview of the backend files and their roles in the project. The project is structured to handle data loading, preprocessing, model training, energy analysis, and visualization in a modular and organized manner.

        *   `prepare_train_test_split`: Splits the data into training and testing sets, scales the features using `StandardScaler`, and returns the scaled data along with the scaler.
    *   **Role**: Transforms raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

## 3. Model Training and Evaluation

*   **`Backend/src/model_training.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Trains and evaluates the machine learning model.
    *   **Key Functions**:
        *   `__init__`: Initializes the `RandomForestRegressor` model with specified parameters.
        *   `train`: Trains the model using the training data.
        *   `evaluate`: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2.
        *   `get_feature_importance`: Extracts and returns the feature importances from the trained model.
        *   `predict`: Makes predictions on new data using the trained model.
    *   **Role**: The core of the machine learning process, responsible for training and assessing the model.

## 4. Energy Analysis

*   **`Backend/src/energy_analysis.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Analyzes energy consumption patterns and provides recommendations.
    *   **Key Functions**:
        *   `__init__`: Initializes the analyzer with the input DataFrame.
        *   `identify_peak_usage_times`: Identifies and prints the hours with the highest average energy consumption.
        *   `analyze_sub_metering_impact`: Calculates and prints the percentage of energy consumption by each sub-metering category.
        *   `generate_energy_recommendations`: Generates energy-saving recommendations based on sub-metering analysis and peak usage times.
        *   `generate_sustainability_report`: Combines all analysis steps and prints a comprehensive sustainability report.
    *   **Role**: Provides insights into energy usage patterns and suggests ways to improve efficiency.

## 5. Visualization

*   **`Backend/src/visualization.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Creates visualizations to help understand the data and model results.

## Flow of Operations

1.  **Initialization**: `__init__.py` sets up the environment, logging, and configurations.
2.  **Data Loading**: `DataLoader` loads and cleans the data.
3.  **Preprocessing**: `DataPreprocessor` extracts features, scales the data, and splits it into training and testing sets.
4.  **Model Training**: `PowerConsumptionModel` trains the model on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: `PowerConsumptionModel` evaluates the model's performance on the test data.
6.  **Feature Importance**: `PowerConsumptionModel` extracts feature importances.
7.  **Energy Analysis**: `EnergyAnalyzer` analyzes energy consumption patterns and generates recommendations.
8.  **Visualization**: `EnergyVisualizer` (or `main.py` directly) creates plots for prediction accuracy, feature importance, and hourly consumption.
9.  **API**: `api.py` exposes the trained model for predictions via a web API.
10. **Main Execution**: `main.py` orchestrates all the above steps.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making the project modular and easier to maintain. Each file has a specific role in the overall process, from data loading to model deployment.
